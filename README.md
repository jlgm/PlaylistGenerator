# PlaylistGenerator
Create a Youtube playlist based on a particular song you like

This app uses data from Last.fm (for finding similar tracks) and then searches for them on Youtube, generating a Playlist afterwards.

## Executing

* Make sure you have Node.js installed
* Go to /server
* `npm install` the dependencies
* Run the server with `node app.js`
* Open *index.html* on a browser
* Type both song name and artist
* Click on *Generate Playlist* at the end of the list
